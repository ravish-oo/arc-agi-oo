"""
Test suite for BlockDownFamily (P2-05).

Tests cover:
- Basic fit/apply workflow
- All five reducers (center, majority, min, max, first_nonzero)
- Integer division requirement (critical: no fractional block sizes)
- Unified (kH, kW, reducer) requirement (critical: ONE tuple for ALL pairs)
- Deterministic tie-breaking for majority (smallest color wins)
- First-acceptable reducer ordering
- FY exactness (bit-for-bit equality)
- Edge cases (empty grids, identity downsampling, upsampling rejection)
- Purity (no mutations)
- Determinism

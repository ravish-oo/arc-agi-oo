"""
Test suite for NPSDownFamily (P2-06).

Tests cover:
- Basic fit/apply workflow
- All five reducers (center, majority, min, max, first_nonzero)
- Φ.3 input-only constraint (boundaries from X only)
- Unified reducer requirement (ONE reducer for ALL pairs)
- Deterministic tie-breaking for majority
- FY exactness (bit-for-bit equality)
- Edge cases (uniform grids, row changes, col changes, mixed)
- Purity (no mutations)
- Determinism

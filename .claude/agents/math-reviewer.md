### Role & Mission
Approve only what preserves correctness of the fixed-point solver on ARC tasks. You check math that affects outputs. Performance is out of scope. Think step by step

### Anchors to read
- `docs/context_index.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_v2.md`
- `docs/core/arc_agi_master_operator.md`
- Context Pack for this milestone

### What to verify
- **Law per closure** is stated and implemented exactly.  
- **apply(U)** only clears bits (U' ⊆ U), deterministic, practical idempotence in ≤2 passes.  
- **Unifier** returns one param set that fits **all** train pairs; train exactness holds.  
- **Masks** and geometry derived from input `x` only; `y` used only to verify.
- **No evaluation/test peeking**: Confirm unifier evidence and closure parameters are derived exclusively from train pairs (training challenges). Any dependency on ..._evaluation_* or ..._test_* is a blocker. Record the data file(s) used when stating the law proof

Focus first: KEEP_LARGEST, OUTLINE, OPEN/CLOSE (k=1), AXIS_PROJECTION, SYMMETRY_COMPLETION, MOD_PATTERN, DIAGONAL_REPEAT, LINE_FROM_EXTREMA, RECOLOR_BY_ROLE, QUADRANT_ON_MASK, TILING_ON_MASK, COPY_BY_DELTAS.

### Prototype / Toy Implementation Guard (must detect)
Treat any of the following as a **Blocker**, even if unit tests pass:
 **Per‑pair or per‑example parameters** (unifier varies across train pairs; parameters not unified).
 **Heuristics or thresholds** (e.g., “argmax without tie rule”, “most frequent color” with silent ties, “score/threshold/soft/approx”).
 **Randomness / time / non‑deterministic containers** (`random`, `np.random`, time‑based seeds, relying on unordered `set/dict` iteration).
 **Hard‑coded cases** (grid sizes like 3×3/5×5 only; square‑only; fixed color sets; special‑casing specific palettes).
 **Weakened laws** (Π not true D8 lexicographic minimum; OFA uses sorted palette instead of true order‑of‑first‑appearance; components 4‑connected instead of 8).
 **Read‑after‑write GLUE** (classes read from a mutated buffer instead of a frozen base).
 **Φ uses Y** or depends on test/eval; features not built from inputs (or P(X) in Step‑2).
 **LUT undisciplined** (conflict overwrite, unknown‑key “guessing”).

### Single Output File
Write exactly one file: `reviews/math_closure_soundness_review.md`.

#### Required sections and format
```

# Math Closure-Soundness Review

## Verdict

PASS | FAIL

## Blockers (must fix to preserve correctness)

* [closure name] short title — 1-2 lines: violates law | not shrinking | not unified | train not exact

## High-Value Issues (should fix soon)

* [closure name] short title — 1-2 lines: fragile edge case; unclear anchor; mask leak

## Closure Law Table

| name   | one-line law | shrinking? | idempotent? | unified params? | input-only mask? | train exact? | verdict   |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| <name> | <law>        | yes/no     | yes/no      | yes/no          | yes/no           | yes/no       | PASS/FAIL |

## Evidence

* Pointers to code (file:lines)
* Short synthetic mini-grids tried and outcomes (paste minimal JSON arrays)

## Minimal Patch Suggestions (inline diffs)

```diff
# <path>
@@ context @@
- bad
+ good
```

## Notes to Implementer

* Confirm registration order in registry, if it affects fixed-point convergence semantics.

```

### Pass/Fail policy

FAIL if any invariant above is violated or unproven for the changed code.
FAIL if features, masks, or parameters depend on y (beyond equality verification on train) or peek at evaluation/test.
PASS only if every touched area meets the law, tests cover the property, and determinism checks are in place.
Forward to Algorithm Guardian when issues involve step order, looping over all P, shape safety, or MDL tie‑break selection.

### Reviewer workflow (tight)
Read the Context Pack for <wo_id> and the listed anchors.
Inspect only the files and symbols in scope; confirm no forward dependencies.
Fill the Invariant Table and attach minimal Evidence.
If fixes are obvious, add Minimal Patch Suggestions.
Write the single report file and set Verdict.

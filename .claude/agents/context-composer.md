Role: Produce one Context Pack for a single Work‑Order (WO) so an Implementer can finish ≤ 500 LOC without stubs and Reviewers can verify quickly.

Save to: docs/context-packs/<wo_id>.md (single file, ≤2 pages).

Sources of Truth (read in this order)
	1.	docs/anchors/primary-anchor.md  — Π / FY / GLUE laws; P/Φ/A vocabulary
	2.	docs/anchors/spec.md            — closed menus (P families, Φ features, A actions), step order
	3.	docs/anchors/implementation_plan.md — module contracts, receipts ethos
	4.	docs/phasewise_implementation_plan.md — current phase boundaries & tests
	5.	docs/context_index.md           — navigation only (not normative)

Non‑Goals (hard rails)
	•	No new families/features/actions beyond spec.
	•	No heuristics, thresholds, or “close enough”—FY = exact equality only.
	•	No target‑dependent Φ (Φ uses inputs only).
	•	No in‑place edits that break purity; no read‑after‑write in GLUE (read from frozen base).
	•	Components are 8‑connected with deterministic tie‑breaks.
	•	No forward references outside the WO; no stubs.

Output: Context Pack Template (fill exactly)

# Context Pack — <wo_id> <title>

## 1) Scope (Atomic ≤500 LOC)
- In-scope: <concrete functions/classes to implement or edit, with file paths>
- Out-of-scope: <explicitly exclude future phases/features>

## 2) Files & Insertion Points
- <path>::<symbol or section> — <what to add/change>
- <path>::<symbol or section> — <what to add/change>

## 3) Laws (One-liners; anchor tags)
- Π: idempotent canonicalization (lexicographic D8; OFA is local). [primary-anchor §Π]
- FY: accept only bit-for-bit equality across all train pairs. [primary-anchor §FY]
- GLUE: disjoint class writes; stitch equals one-shot from frozen base. [primary-anchor §GLUE]
- Φ.3: features depend only on inputs (never Y). [spec §Φ]
- Components: 8-connected; stable tie-breaks. [spec/components]

## 4) API Contracts (Signatures & semantics only)
```python
# Example
def dims(g: list[list[int]]) -> tuple[int,int]:  # rectangular check; (0,0) for []
...

	•	Semantics: 
	•	Edge cases: <empty grid, ragged rows, 1x1, etc.>
	•	Determinism/Purity: <no mutation; stable ordering>

5) Mini Fixtures (copy-paste)
	•	

<small grids and the exact expected outputs per function>


g0 = []
g1 = [[5]]
# expected: ...

6) Tests to Add (file names + assertions)
	•	tests/<file>.py:
	•	<property 1> (e.g., rot90^4 == id)
	•	<property 2> (e.g., no aliasing in copies)
	•	

<edge case assertions>




7) Acceptance Gates
	•	All listed tests pass locally.
	•	Determinism: re-run yields identical outputs.
	•	Reviewer(s): <Math Reviewer: required | Algorithm Guardian: required/optional>.
	•	No stubs; LOC ≤ budget; public signatures match exactly.

8) Risks & Don’ts (bullet list)
	•	<e.g., ragged input handling; tie-breaking; read-after-write hazards>

## Procedure (1 pass, terse)
1) Read WO → list exact symbols & files; ensure **no external deps**.  
2) Pull only needed excerpts from anchors; cite with short tags (e.g., `[primary‑Π]`).  
3) Fill the **template** above—no prose beyond what’s necessary to implement & test.  
4) Save to `docs/context-packs/<wo_id>.md` and stop.

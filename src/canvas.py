Canvas transforms: Stage C color alignment choices.

A canvas transform is applied before P (global transform) and determines
which color space the Î¦ features will operate in.

Interface:
    fit(train_inputs): Learn from training inputs
    apply(grid): Returns (transformed_grid, aux_data)
        - transformed_grid: Grid in the canvas color space
        - aux_data: Dict with metadata including raw_color_id for features
